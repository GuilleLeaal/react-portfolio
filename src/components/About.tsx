          I am currently in the final stage of the <span className="text-teal-400">Information Technology Analyst</span> degree at ORT Uruguay University â€“ School of Engineering.
          I have completed all academic semesters and elective courses, and I am now finishing the final <span className="text-teal-400">4-week workshop</span> to earn my degree.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          I hold an intermediate degree as a <span className="text-teal-400">Web Developer</span> and have solid knowledge of
          <span className="text-teal-400"> JavaScript, C#, Java, SQL, React</span>, and other technologies.
          I also gained hands-on experience working as a backend developer using <span className="text-teal-400">JavaScript and NetSuite</span>,
          which strengthened my backend skills while maintaining my interest in frontend and other areas of IT.
        </p>

        <p>
          I consider myself a <span className="text-teal-400">proactive and responsible person with a strong ability to learn and adapt</span>.
          I enjoy working in a team, contributing ideas, and taking on new challenges that help me grow both professionally and personally.
